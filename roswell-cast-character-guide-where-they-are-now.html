The series is based on the Young Adult book series, <strong>Roswell High</strong>, by Melinda Metz. Teen angst takes on a whole new level when one human, Liz (<strong>Shiri Appleby</strong>), and one alien, Max (<strong>Jason Behr</strong>), fall in love. When Max’s fellow aliens, Michael (<strong>Brendan Fehr</strong>) and Isabel (<strong>Katherine Heigl</strong>), discover their budding romance, they clash with Liz’s best friends, Maria (<strong>Majandra Delfino</strong>) and Alex (<strong>Colin Hanks</strong>). Thankfully, the group is able to find common ground and work together against the true enemy; authority. This show ended nearly 20 years ago in May 2002.

When her crush, Max Evans, suddenly heals her, she discovers he is an alien. Their romantic complications are the basis for the entirety of the series. Liz constantly wants to do the right thing, but like everyone at her age, is overpowered by her love for Max.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Roswell, Appleby had recurring roles on <strong>ER, Chicago Fire</strong>, and <strong>Girls</strong>.

Max is the figurative (and literal) leader of the aliens on Earth, a fact that frequently invokes conflict with Michael and Isabel. He is torn between his loyalty to his fellow aliens and his undeniable love for Liz. At first, his power is healing, obviously, but as the series goes on he discovers he is more powerful than anyone thought possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Behr received critical acclaim for his role in the film, <strong>The Shipping News</strong>.

While Max and Isabel were adopted by the kind Evans family, Michael ended up in the foster care system with a less-than-stellar appointed guardian. He is hot-headed and his emotions frequently get him into trouble. He has a tumultuous romance with Maria and is skeptical of Liz for quite a while. As the series goes on, he learns responsibility in his role in the alien group as well as in his relationship.</p><p>Brendan Fehr went on to have recurring TV roles in <strong>CSI: Miami</strong>, <strong>Bones</strong>, and <strong>Wynonna Earp</strong> as well as appearing in such films as <strong>Silent Night</strong> and <strong>Guardians of the Galaxy</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=isabel-evans-katherine-heigl>Isabel Evans (Katherine Heigl)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Roswell-Katherine-Heigl.jpeg><p>Isabel is Max’s sister and does her best to keep everyone at arm’s length. She has the power of invading people’s minds to see what they’re really thinking. When she casually waltzes into Alex’s subconscious, she finds that she’s already there as he is dreaming about her. The two then begin a sweet romance. She is fiercely protective of her brother and Michael and finds herself at odds with Liz a lot. Eventually, she finds a way to let her guard down and let friends and love in.</p><p>Post Roswell, Heigl gained fame through her starring role on <strong><a href=#>Grey’s Anatomy</a>.</strong> She also starred in such films as <strong>Knocked Up, 27 Dresses</strong>, and <a href=#><strong>Unforgettable</strong></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maria-deluca-majandra-delfino>Maria DeLuca (Majandra Delfino)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Rowell-Majandra-Delfino.jpg><p>Even though sworn to secrecy, Liz has no choice but to confess the truth to her best friend, Maria, about Max and company. Maria is panicked at first but soon settles in to support their new friends. She falls in love with Michael against her better judgment and the two turn out to be the true power couple of the show. Their relationship is comical, passionate, and full of chemistry.</p><p>Majandra Delfino has also starred in <strong>Quarterlife</strong>, <strong>State of Georgia,</strong> and <strong>Friends with Better Lives</strong>.</p><h2 id=alex-whitman-colin-hanks>Alex Whitman (Colin Hanks)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Roswell-Colin-Hanks.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alex is kept in the dark as long as possible in regards to the truth about Max. But once Liz reveals the secret, Alex is sucked into a world he never could have imagined. Unfortunately for them, and for us, Hanks is the first casualty of the group of friends in the second season and Hanks left the show. He returned for a cameo in Season 3 in Isabel’s dreams.</p><p>Hanks has starred in a number of films including <strong>Orange County</strong>, <strong>King Kong</strong>, and <strong>Parkland</strong>.

After many tense moments, he and Max finally end up bonding and Kyle becomes a sort of comic relief. When he discovers the truth in the first season finale, he does not react as well as the others. He is extremely shaken up and scared, and it takes him a long time to come around to feeling normal around Max and the others. Thankfully, he becomes one of their biggest allies for the rest of the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Roswell, Wechsler went on to starring roles in <strong>Revenge</strong>, <strong>Chicago PD</strong>, and <strong>Shades of Blue</strong>.</p><h2 id=sheriff-jim-valenti-william-sadler>Sheriff Jim Valenti (William Sadler)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Roswell-William-Sadler.jpg><p>As Kyle’s dad, Sheriff Jim serves as the antagonist for the entire first season. His character takes a sharp turn towards the end of the season when he finds out the truth about Max, Isabel, and Michael. When he sees that they’re just kids and they are being hunted by the government, he vows to protect them no matter what the cost is. Turning from antagonist to father figure, Sheriff Jim teaches the aliens that sometimes humans aren’t all that bad.</p><p><strong>William Sadler</strong> has appeared in film and television since the late 1970s, but it was his comedic portrayal of “Death” in <strong>Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey</strong> (as well as <strong>Bill and Ted Face the Music</strong>) that endeared him to audiences forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tess-harding-emilie-de-ravin>Tess Harding (Emilie de Ravin)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Roswell-Emilie-De-Ravin.jpeg><p>The mysterious new girl at school who turns out to be the fourth alien from the crash also happens to be Max’s bride from their home planet. Tess seamlessly shifts back and forth between ally, antagonist, and downright villain. Her love triangle with Max and Liz provides a lot of tension for the happy couple. Tess has a mind-warping power that is as useful as it is deadly.</p><p><strong>Emilie de Ravin</strong> starred in such films as <strong>Brick</strong> and <strong>Remember Me</strong>, but is probably best known as Claire on <strong>Lost</strong> and Belle on <strong>Once Upon a Time</strong>.</p><p>The series also had some famous guest stars such as <strong>Jonathan Frakes</strong>, <strong>Howie Dorough</strong>, <strong>Nelly</strong><strong>Furtado</strong>, <strong>Morgan Fairchild</strong>, and <strong>Joe Pantoliano</strong>. The series was canceled after its 3rd season which left our merry hybrid of humans and aliens as nomads wandering around the country looking for further signs of alien life forms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2018, the CW launched a reimagined version of the series, <a href=#><strong>Roswell, New Mexico</strong></a>.
