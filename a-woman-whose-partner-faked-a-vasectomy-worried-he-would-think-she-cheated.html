Other businesses were also conned.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But that wasn’t the worst. As the scale of the deception emerged, Coleen realised she had also been tricked into having his child — Wilson lied about having had a vasectomy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The birth nearly ended up killing Coleen and son Charlie, who was born prematurely.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Which makes what happened even worse. Because when Wilson’s lies finally unravelled, he simply handed over the baby and drove off, saying he would be ‘back in a minute’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It would be the last time Coleen and her son would ever see him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now, as Wilson starts a six-year jail term for crimes the judge at Durham Crown Court called ‘jaw-droppingly’ cruel and arrogant, she has revealed how the lies ruined her life and cast a shadow over that of her son.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘One of the hardest things I will have to do is, in the future, to sit down with my wonderful son and explain the horrendous truth about his father’s deception,’ she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Like many modern romances, this one began online, when the pair met on match.com in September 2014.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Wilson used the profile ‘Firefighter J’, claiming his name was James Scott and that he worked for County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service. It was a pretence he would maintain until February 2017, fooling not only Coleen but her family and friends as well.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was seven years his senior, worked for a lettings agency and had two broken marriages behind her.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Wilson would use his job to justify why he couldn’t be with her all the time, claiming his shift patterns kept him at the fire station.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Born in Sunderland, he had actually married in 2002.

But he liked flashy clothes, designer watches and smart cars. He liked to play the big man. That money gave him the taste for a flash lifestyle and he did everything he could to play at being successful, when in fact he did nothing and never earned a penny of what he had.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She added: ‘He is a narcissist who gets a kick from thinking he is cleverer than everyone else, that he can fool anyone because he’s the smartest guy around. In fact he’s just cruel and sickeningly selfish.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With a taste for the high life and no way to fund it, Wilson told his wife he had got a job working nights at a golf centre. In fact, he had Coleen in his sights.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He admitted to his new girlfriend that he had been married in the past, but claimed his ex-wife had moved to Texas with their children.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He also boasted about his bravery at work. Tellingly, to this day, Coleen still refers to him by the false name she always knew him by.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I heard a story of James jumping out of the window of a burning building with a small child, saving his life and breaking his back during the fall,’ she would recall in a statement prepared for the court hearing earlier this week. I even saw a thank- you card from the boy, and texts of gratitude from the child’s parents.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Soon those lies spread into their personal lives. In 2015 Coleen fell pregnant and it was agreed that she would have a termination.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I have children from a previous relationship and felt my family was complete,’ she said in the statement. ‘James decided to have a vasectomy, as I was fearful of falling pregnant again. James told me he attended hospital to have this done. I saw him after the operation and saw bruising and dressings on his penis.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I was also shown a medical report which showed he now had nil sperm count. Two months after seeing this report I fell pregnant again.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The feeling of disbelief was staggering. I was horrified people would think I’d been unfaithful. But James took the news well, stating there was a one in 200 chance of pregnancy after a vasectomy.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But the ‘miracle’ pregnancy did not go well. ‘My waters broke at 23 weeks and I needed an emergency C-section,’ said Coleen. ‘I nearly died and my baby was put on a life-support machine. We were told there was a chance he wouldn’t make it.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Their baby boy, born in February 2016, was named Charlie and given the made-up surname Scott.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Knowing Coleen had always wanted to run a wine bar, in March 2016 he floated the idea of buying a property on the Newcastle Quayside, to be called ‘@Scotts’. Coleen’s sister Karen Crear was also to be involved.</p><img decoding=async id=i-5de3200483709c6 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/10/22/27057776-8209385-Wilson_talked_about_buying_this_bar_on_Newcastle_s_Quayside_to_t-a-8_1586555668747.jpg height=476 width=634 alt="Wilson talked about buying this bar on Newcastle's Quayside to turn it into a boutique hotel and bar" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Wilson talked about buying this bar on Newcastle’s Quayside to turn it into a boutique hotel and bar</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Wilson began by forging a bank statement showing his mother had transferred £2 million into his account. Emails were exchanged between his mother’s business manager and her accountant. Neither existed. As prosecutor Richard Herrmann observed, Wilson was ‘having email conversations with himself’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Coleen viewed the site on four occasions. Each time the plans became more elaborate — Gordon Ramsay, Wilson told her, was going to run the restaurant; singer Sam Smith would headline the opening party. Other businesses were dragged into the fraud, doing marketing work for which they would never be paid.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Next, in August 2016, Wilson proposed that the three of them should set up a property company called Gemini. It would manage properties he claimed his mother owned, and others they would buy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He knew the idea would appeal to the sisters — Coleen worked for a lettings agency and her sister owned properties in the area. So he drew up a list of properties he claimed his mother owned that would be transferred to Gemini.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was fabricated — as were the tenants said to be living in them. One was footballer Jack Rodwell, who at the time played for Sunderland. Again, other businesses were dragged into the fraud.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To help get the projects off the ground, the sisters handed over more than £57,000 to Wilson. Both also quit their jobs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the same time, Wilson was negotiating to buy a new £1.5 million house on a development linked to Ramside Hall, another luxury hotel in Durham. So convincing was he, the developers gave him free lifetime membership of the linked gym, spa and golf course.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another fraud involved Newcastle Falcons rugby club, which gave him exclusive membership in exchange for sponsorship money that never materialised.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Some money that did change hands was £10,000 from Coleen’s sister in December 2016. It was supposed to go towards the new businesses but instead Wilson blew it on a Mini Cooper.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By then the couple’s wedding was fast approaching — a big problem, as Wilson was still married.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He then claimed to be suffering from suspected testicular cancer, and the wedding was put back from December to February 2017.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As the date neared, Wilson said he was off to America to pick up his daughters so they could attend. Another lie. When he ‘returned’ four days before the wedding, he tearfully told Coleen his ex had banned them from coming.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By now deeply suspicious, Coleen’s sister started to dig into Wilson’s background, discovering that the wedding had in fact never been booked at the venue.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On what was intended to be the wedding day, Ms Crear confronted Wilson as he and her sister came home from the supermarket. Wilson unloaded the shopping and handed baby Charlie to one of Coleen’s daughters. He then got into the car, saying he would be back in a minute, and drove away. He never returned.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The police were informed and Wilson was arrested.</p><img decoding=async id=i-ac0aebc4fc4a5f4b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/02/27/12/27057738-11798093-In_January_he_pleaded_guilty_to_eight_counts_of_fraud_two_of_for-a-4_1677502040198.jpg height=765 width=634 alt="In January, he pleaded guilty to eight counts of fraud, two of forgery and one each of converting criminal property and making a false statement about a birth.
