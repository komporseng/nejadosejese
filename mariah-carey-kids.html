anniversary. <span class=credit>Instagram/mariahcarey</span></figure><p>Since calling it quits, the pair have put on a united front to support their children, whom they affectionately nicknamed Roc and Roe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4>“They’re a lot, but they give me so much love in return. I wouldn’t be the same person without them,” Carey&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told People</a> in 2019.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4>“I think Nick and I have done pretty well in co-parenting, staying friends with each other so that we can talk,” she continued.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">The pair have made a slew of public appearances, including at the 2023 Billboard Music Awards. <span class=credit>Penske Media via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6>“I want my kids to understand that every child isn’t as fortunate as they are. … It’s hard, but I try to keep them grounded so they don’t think everything is just handed to them.”</p><p>Through the years, Moroccan and Monroe have dipped in and out of the spotlight, <a href=#>appearing with their mom at the&nbsp;2022 Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</a> and even <a href=#>presenting her with a special Billboard Music Award</a>&nbsp;the following year.</p><p>Read on for everything you need to know about the twins.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Monroe Cannon</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Monroe is the singer’s mini-me. <span class=credit>Instagram/mariahcarey</span></figure><p>Carey’s daughter, Monroe, was her firstborn.</p><p>The “Obsessed” singer wrote in her 2020 memoir,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>“The Meaning of Mariah Carey,”</a> that she wanted both of her kids to share her initials.</p><p>She noted that her daughter’s moniker was inspired by&nbsp;Marilyn Monroe; however, Carey refers to her as Roe. (Unlike Moroccan, Monroe doesn’t have a middle name.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28>Much like her mom, the youngster proved she has a set of pipes when she performed “Always Be My Baby” onstage in Los Angeles in 2017.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">She has appeared onstage with her mom on several occasions. <span class=credit>Getty Images for MC</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30>“Miss Monroe has a really, really good ear for music and a really beautiful tone, but I can’t force her to sing, so if she wants to sing, she’ll sing,” Carey said in 2016.</p><p>And the pop diva’s mini-me is a multihyphenate talent, as she <a href=#>made her modeling debut</a> in a 2021 OshKosh B’Gosh commercial, in which she played a younger version of her mom.</p><p>“As a little girl, I was determined to realize my dreams,” Carey said in a voice-over.</p><p>“Now as a mother, it brings me so much joy to see my children visualize and develop the dreams they hold in their own hearts.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Monroe has also been in social media videos with both of her parents, who have attested to her sweet nature. <span class=credit>FilmMagic</span></figure><p>As she entered her preteen years, Monroe continued to display her passion for music when she&nbsp;joined Carey onstage in Toronto in 2022&nbsp;for a performance of “Away in a Manger.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33>She and her brother have also made a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slew of hilarious videos</a> with their parents, revealing they may have inherited some of their dad’s humor.</p><p>In a 2023 interview on the&nbsp;“Howie Mandel Does Stuff”&nbsp;podcast, Cannon described the twins as “so intelligent” and “in tune with their own values.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13>“It’s my first time having 12-year-olds, and I have a set of them! And&nbsp;we’re having real conversations,” he explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13>“Because, you know, their lives are far from normal. Their mom is one of the biggest entertainers to ever live — and their dad is me.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Moroccan Scott Cannon</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Moroccan’s outgoing personality resembles that of his TV personality father. <span class=credit>nickcannon/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53>Moroccan was born just after his sister.</p><p>In keeping with Carey’s desire for “MC” initials, he was named after the Moroccan-inspired decor in the singer’s New York City apartment, where she <a href=#>got engaged</a> to the “Wild ‘N Out” star.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53>Although Moroccan, who goes by both Roc and Rocky, has appeared in several modeling campaigns with his family through the years and has even taken the stage with the “Touch My Body” singer multiple times, he seems to keep a slightly lower profile than his sister.</p><p>He appeared on his mom’s Instagram after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they adopted two kittens</a> in 2013 and when he adorable lost one of his teeth in 2017.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55>“My tooth fell out and I’m so excited and so happy. I want to show my mom so bad,” the then-5-year-old sweetly said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Much like his sister, he has appeared onstage with Carey through the years. <span class=credit>Getty Images for MC</span></figure><p>He also featured in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a video from New Year’s Eve 2020</a>, in which he gave a hilarious speech.</p><p>“A lot of people might’ve not thought that this year was perfect, but this year was inspiring to me … ’cause I had it too good for too long, man,” Moroccan said. “And I just was like ‘Ah, this is so good,’ and I needed a jumpstart.”</p><p>Moroccan’s dad revealed his mini-me has a funny side — and even once called him a “player” in reference to <a href=#>his ever-growing brood of children</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60>“It’s the funniest thing, my kids call me a player. I was like, ‘Who taught you that word? Who’s been talking to you?'” Cannon&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told “Entertainment Tonight”</a> in 2020. “And [Moroccan’s] like, ‘Dad, you can’t be a player forever.’ I’m like, this is the worst.”</p><p>Moroccan’s sense of humor was even corroborated by Kim Kardashian, who called him “the funniest kid” in a 2023 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV%2BlrrOxza2qaKWRp7aitIycmKudqWK4qrDSaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ty-panitz.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ty Panitz</a>
