He is known to many as a comedian, actor, television host, and humorous relief.</strong></p><p><strong>A sense of humor is an excellent trait to possess. His humor has captivated both men and women, as well as the gay community.</strong><br><strong>Eris is notorious for going to extreme lengths for pranks and skits.</strong></p><p>He’s also slipped in a few stirring moments, such as kissing a man, leading some to wonder if it’s all a front or if Eric is genuinely gay.</p><h2><span id=Is_Eric_Andre_a_gay_man>Is Eric André a gay man?</span></h2><p>Eric has been outspoken on many issues, but here is where he stops. He has neither acknowledged nor disputed his sexuality, and he has not explicitly responded to concerns concerning his sexuality.</p><p>Plus, with a clever mind like his, you can think he can easily evade those inquiries.&nbsp; Eric André has already told details about his dating history with women, but no men appear to have made the list.</p><p>You would believe that being gay is out of the question for this comic. However, in an interview with Towleroad, he perplexed viewers by claiming that there is no such thing as sexual orientation.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read Harvey David White, Matt Doherty, Omari Giraud-Hutchinson, Lewis Hall"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1061505,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"12":0,"15":"Arial","16":9,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":10,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":42}{"1":44,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":67}{"1":69,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":10,"2":"https://sportskicker.com/player/harvey-david-white/"}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":"https://sportskicker.com/player/matt-doherty-2/"}{"1":42}{"1":44,"2":"https://sportskicker.com/player/omari-giraud-hutchinson/"}{"1":67}{"1":69,"2":"https://sportskicker.com/player/lewis-hall/"}{"1":79}'>Also Read <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Harvey David White</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Matt Doherty</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Omari Giraud-Hutchinson</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Lewis Hall</a></span></p><h2><span id=Eric_Andre8217s_gay_rumor-sparking_tweet>Eric Andre’s gay rumor-sparking tweet</span></h2><p>Eric reportedly has a sizable fan base in the gay community, therefore when asked about sexuality, he responded. Isn’t it true that everyone is bi?</p><p>There are no such concepts as sexual orientation, race, or gender. All of them are outdated man-made conceptions.</p><p>Was it a hint that he was bisexual? When addressed the subject, though, he evaded it by replying, “I’ll f*** anything that moves,” which is neither confirmation nor denial.</p><p>Andre seemed to be having a good time teasing me about the subject. But one thing is certain: he is completely opposed to homophobia. Although his jokes are a little edgy, he is aware of the implications.</p><p><strong>“It’s bad if the purpose is to hurt, divide, or belittle; it’s not wrong if the intention is to cope with or make sense of tragedy.</strong><br><strong>“I think the audience can identify if it’s commenting on society’s shortcomings vs adding to society’s flaws,” he stated of popular homophobic “jokes.” “in the 1980s</strong></p><p>So Eric has once again deftly eased his way out of the questioning.</p><p>Nonetheless, he’s not lacking in dates.</p><h2><span id=Is_Eric_Andre_Married>Is Eric Andre Married?</span></h2><p>You might think so, but the 37-year-old is not in a hurry and prefers to get to know more individuals before settling down. His famous romance was with actress Rosario Dawson.</p><p>They dated for nearly a year, from 2016 to 2017, before splitting up. Of course, it’s tough to believe anything that comes out of this prankster’s mouth, and many people assumed it was all a hoax when he uploaded (since removed) photos of himself with Rosario on Instagram.</p><p>But it turns out that the two were in love. Eric later acknowledged dating someone in 2021. He said that he met the girl at a farmer’s market and that she had no idea who he was.</p><p>They went on a few dates after that, but his current relationship status is unknown because he hasn’t addressed the enigmatic girl since.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Juan Williams Of Fox News Quits The Five! 43 Years Married Life"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/juan-williams-of-fox-news-quits-the-five-43-years-married-life/"}{"1":74}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Juan Williams Of Fox News Quits The Five! 43 Years Married Life</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Comedian</a> <a href=# rel=tag>host</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>All About Luca Marinelli !
